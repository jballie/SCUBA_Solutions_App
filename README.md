# Scuba_Solutions_App
Capstone Project at WTCC

SCUBA Solutions is an integrated system that provides an easy to use application simplifying the business processes encountered by a dive shop with boat-charted dives.  This app allows personnel to schedule single or recurring dive events.  Additionally, the app stores customer profiles and the user can create reservations for the customer on specific dive trips.  When a customer requests a reservation, an email is sent with the required liability waiver that must be completed.  Once the customer returns the waiver and provides payment, the user updates the corresponding statuses in the program.  At this time, the customerâ€™s reservation is confirmed on the dive trip and an email to the customer is generated.  Another functionality is the dive trip cancellation feature.  This is used when inclement weather is anticipated and the dive trip needs to be cancelled.  By clicking the cancel dive trip button, cancellation emails are automatically sent to all divers with requested or confirmed reservations on the dive trip.
